		<p class="p">The NGramSplitter_MLE function <dfn class="term">tokenizes</dfn> (splits) an input stream of text and outputs <var class="keyword varname">n</var> multigrams (called <var class="keyword varname">n</var><dfn class="term">-grams</dfn>) based on the specified delimiter and reset parameters. NGramSplitter_MLE provides more flexibility than standard tokenization when performing text analysis. Many two-word phrases carry important meaning (for example, "machine learning") that unigrams (single-word tokens) do not capture. This, combined with additional analytical techniques, can be useful for performing sentiment analysis, topic identification, and document classification.</p>

		<p class="p">NGramSplitter_MLE considers each input row to be one document, and returns a row for each unique <var class="keyword varname">n</var>-gram in each document. NGramSplitter_MLE also returns, for each document, the counts of each <var class="keyword varname">n</var>-gram and the total number of <var class="keyword varname">n</var>-grams.</p>
