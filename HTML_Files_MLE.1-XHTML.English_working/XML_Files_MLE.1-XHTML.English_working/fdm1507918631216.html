<p class="p">Neural network technology has advanced significantly. More advanced neural networks such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term memory networks (LSTM) are now the state of the art in image recognition, automated translation and other applications.</p>
<p class="p">Teradata is in the process of implementing a more advanced NeuralNet function, more suitable for large data sets and complex connectivity, which produces more accurate results in less time.</p>
<p class="p">Please contact your account representative or solutions architect, who will contact Teradata Analytics Strategic Offer Management staff. Teradata Analytics Strategic Offer Management staff will help you implement your use case with the right combination of NeuralNet, XGBoost, or other functions.</p>
