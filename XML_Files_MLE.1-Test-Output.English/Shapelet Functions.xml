   <p style="line-height: 1em;">Shapelets are contiguous subsequences of a time series that identify a class with high accuracy. Because shapelets focus on local features of a time series, they can be more accurate and faster than other time-series classification methods. Shapelets can also identify interpretable results, providing useful insights into differences between classes.</p>
   <p style="line-height: 1em;">Any classification task that must preserve ordering can be characterized as time-series classification. Many real-world use cases involve data that varies only slightly. Traditional classifiers may be unable to classify such data with high precision.</p>

   <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
   <p style="line-height: 1em;">The most common use cases are long-term trends with small local pattern changes that distinguish trends from each other. Almost any time-series classification problem can be mapped to a shapelets discovery problem. For example:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Clickstream analysis</li>
      <li>Scientific or health applications such as ECG analysis</li>
      <li>Imaging applications such as gesture recognition or motion analysis</li>
      <li>Manufacturing applications such as process anomaly detection</li>
      <li>Financial applications such as stock price analysis</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Normalization</h2>
   <p style="line-height: 1em;">Before a shapelets function classifies or clusters a set of time series, it normalizes and SAX-encodes them. Normalization is required because shapelet classification depends on the distance between two time series. SAX-encoding makes patterns in the data easier to identify and compare. For more information about SAX-encoding, see SAX.</p>
