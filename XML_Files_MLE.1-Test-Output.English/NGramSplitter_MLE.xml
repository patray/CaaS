	  <h1>NGramSplitter_MLE</h1>

	
		<p style="line-height: 1em;">The NGramSplitter_MLE function tokenizes (splits) an input stream of text and outputs <i>n</i> multigrams (called <i>n</i>-grams) based on the specified delimiter and reset parameters. NGramSplitter_MLE provides more flexibility than standard tokenization when performing text analysis. Many two-word phrases carry important meaning (for example, "machine learning") that unigrams (single-word tokens) do not capture. This, combined with additional analytical techniques, can be useful for performing sentiment analysis, topic identification, and document classification.</p>

		<p style="line-height: 1em;">NGramSplitter_MLE considers each input row to be one document, and returns a row for each unique <i>n</i>-gram in each document. NGramSplitter_MLE also returns, for each document, the counts of each <i>n</i>-gram and the total number of <i>n</i>-grams.</p>

      <dt>TextColumn</dt>
      <dd>Specify the name of the column that contains the input text. This column must have a SQL string data type.</dd>
      <dt>Delimiter</dt>
      <dd>[Optional] Specify, with a regular expression, the character or string that separates words in the input text.</dd>
      <dd>Default: "\\s+" (all whitespace characters—space, tab, newline, carriage return and others)</dd>
      <dt>Grams</dt>
      <dd>Specify the length, in words, of each <i>n</i>-gram (that is, the value of <i>n</i>). A <i>value_range</i> has the syntax <i>integer1</i>-<i>integer2</i>, where <i>integer1</i> &lt;= <i>integer2</i>. The values of <i>n</i>, <i>integer1</i>, and <i>integer2</i> must be positive.</dd>
      <dt>OverLapping</dt>
      <dd>[Optional] Specify whether the function allows overlapping <i>n</i>-grams.</dd>
      <dd>Default: 'true' (Each word in each sentence starts an <i>n</i>-gram, if enough words follow it in the same sentence to form a whole <i>n</i>-gram of the specified size. For information on sentences, see the Reset syntax element description.)</dd>

      <dd>Default: 'true'</dd>
      <dt>Reset</dt>
      <dd>[Optional] Specify, with a regular expression, the character or string that ends a sentence. At the end of a sentence, the function discards any partial <i>n</i>-grams and searches for the next <i>n</i>-gram at the beginning of the next sentence. An <i>n</i>-gram cannot span sentences.<p>

If you specify 'true', the TotalCountColName syntax element determines the name of the output table column that contains these totals.<p>

It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a finite set of values are called classification trees. In these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.</div>
